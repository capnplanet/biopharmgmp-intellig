# AI Agent Platform for Biotech/Pharma GMP Manufacturing Oversight

An integrated AI-powered platform that provides real-time manufacturing oversight, quality management, and predictive analytics for biotechnology and pharmaceutical GMP manufacturing environments.


1. **Precision-Focused**: Every data point is traceable, validated, and compliant with regulatory standards (ICH, ISO, GMP)
2. **Intelligence-Driven**: Proactive identification of quality risks through predictive analytics and pattern recognition
3. **Audit-Ready**: Complete transparency with exportable audit trails and AI explainability for regulatory compliance

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- This platform requires sophisticated data integration, real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and regulatory compliance features that span multiple interconnected systems

- **Trigger**: Manual

### Predictive Analytics Engine
- **Functionality**: Live monitoring of batch execution, equipment status, and critical process parameters
- **Purpose**: Immediate visibility into production state and early warning of deviations
- **Trigger**: Automatic loading on platform access, updates every 30 seconds
- **Progression**: Platform load → Dashboard display → Real-time data streams → Alert notifications → Action triggers
- **Success criteria**: Sub-second data refresh, 99.9% uptime, zero missed critical alerts

### eQMS Integration & Workflow Management
- **Functionality**: Manages deviations, investigations, CAPAs, effectiveness checks, and change controls through AI-assisted workflows
- **Purpose**: Ensures regulatory compliance and systematic quality improvement
- **Trigger**: Manual creation or automatic generation from manufacturing data
- **Progression**: Event detection → Workflow initiation → AI assistance → Review process → Approval → Implementation → Effectiveness tracking
- **Success criteria**: 100% workflow compliance, automated routing, complete audit trail

- **Investigation Deadlocks**: 
- **Functionality**: ML-powered analysis of historical and real-time MES data to predict quality issues and equipment failures
The interface should evoke confidence, precision, and technological soph
- **Trigger**: Continuous background processing with scheduled model updates
- **Progression**: Data ingestion → Feature engineering → Model prediction → Risk scoring → Alert generation → Recommendation delivery
- **Success criteria**: >85% prediction accuracy, <5% false positive rate, explainable results
